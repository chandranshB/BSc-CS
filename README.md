# BSc-CS

Welcome to **BSc-CS**, a comprehensive repository showcasing my journey through my BSc in Computer Science. This repository organizes all of my college coding work by semester, offering a clear and structured view of my projects, assignments, and coursework.

## Overview

**BSc-CS** is designed to document my academic progression. Each semester is divided into subject-specific directories that house code samples, projects, and assignments. This organized approach not only serves as a portfolio of my growth as a developer but also acts as a personal archive for future reference.

## Repository Structure
```bash
BSc-CS/
├── Sem-1/
│   ├── [Subject-1]/
│   │   ├── assignments/
│   │   └── projects/
│   ├── [Subject-2]/
│   └── ...
├── Sem-2/
│   ├── [Subject-1]/
│   ├── [Subject-2]/
│   └── ...
├── ...
└── README.md

```


Each directory may include its own README file to provide context, instructions, and insights specific to the coursework contained within.

## Repository Stats

Below are some dynamic badges that showcase my coding activity and highlight the primary programming languages I use:
